I've just completed the final lesson in the Full Stack Web Dev track! I've learned a ton over the course of my journey through Flatiron's program. I'm still a little fuzzy on React + Redux, but more so on Redux, like there's a couple more lightbulb moments until I really grasp the lessons. I'll dive into the final project soon and I'll probably end up reviewing the entire React + Redux curriculem in order to prep myself. The final project should be a really good learning experience
