Why did I decide to switch to software engineering? There's nothing wrong with the path I was on but I felt like maybe I was better suited for something else, something more techie and quicker paced. My foray into software development started my senior year of university where I decided to take an elective called mechatronics as part of my major. In this class, my partner and I created a system that would use three force sensors in a triangle pattern as input, and then output their measurements and make a beep when the input across all three sensors were equal. In order to get this functionality working, we ended up writing assembly.

That class sparked my interest in software and in the following semester, I took an intro to Python class where I learned the fundamentals of Python and object oriented programming. Since graduating, I learned more about OO programing and dipped my toes into Java by taking a Coursera course. Although it was interesting I felt that I wouldn't really get anywhere without completing an actual software development program, which is how I discovered Flatiron. :)
