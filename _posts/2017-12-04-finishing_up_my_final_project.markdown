I'm just about finished up with my final project for Flatiron! For this project I decided to make am Imgur browsing app that displays the images from Imgur's front page. Each image can be clicked and then the user is linked to the full sized version of image or images, if the image corresponds to an album. On the image show page the user can click a link to add the image/album to their favorites, where my React + Redux app connects with a Rails backend to store the favorites data. On the favorites page there is a "like" button associated with each favorite which can be clicked. Each click increases the "like" count by one, and this like data is persisted via Redux and Rails. 

It feels good to be "done" with this project. It's only done in the sense of it passes the project requirements, but it still needs many more features to feel more like a real app. I still need a ton of practice to get better at coding, so I'll attempt to flesh out this app while I job hunt. I may be done with Flatiron, but my coding journey is just beginning.
