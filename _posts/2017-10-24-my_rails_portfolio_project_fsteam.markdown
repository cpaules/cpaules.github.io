For my Rails portfolio project I decided to improve my Sinatra project, Sfeam. Apart from slightly modifying the name, I added compatibility with the Devise gem, the ability to sign into the app using a Facebook account, tags to help identify or describe a game, data validations, and a system to keep track of a user's account balance. It also carries over the ratings system that I had created for the original Sinatra project. 
I found the most challenging thing about my project was putting everything together and making sure everything worked properly.
