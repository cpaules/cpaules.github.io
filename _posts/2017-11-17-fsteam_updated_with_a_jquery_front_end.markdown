For my fourth portfolio project I have updated my Rails app, FSteam 2.0, to have a jQuery front end. Since it's the same repo I decided not to update the name to 2.1 or anything. So what this update brings is the ability to interact with portions of the website without needing to refresh the page. For example, now when you view the show page for a game you can click next game to view and the next game will be loaded without a page refresh. The scale of this project was not that large so it was not that difficult to complete.
