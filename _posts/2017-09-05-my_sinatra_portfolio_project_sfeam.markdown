For my Sinatra portfolio project I created Sfeam, aka Flatiron Steam! The general premise of my app is that users can add games to Sfeam, add games on Sfeam into their own game library, and then rate their own games. On the homepage are the links to create users, create new games, and next to each existing game is the game's average rating across all users. My insperation for this project was Valve Software's Steam, a popular online marketplace for computer games, except in my version all the games are free. 

Creating Sfeam was a fun process! After I wrote the sections to handle the games and users, I moved onto creating the ratings functionality which I thought was a little challenging. The part I thought was most difficult was making sure when a user created a rating, it was properly associated with the game and was easily accessible. 

Overall, this project was a fun experience :)
